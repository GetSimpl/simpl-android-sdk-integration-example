# Simpl Android SDK migration from old(before 1.1.6) to new(1.1.+)

## Add new permission in your AndroidManifest.xml
In AndroidManifest.xml of your application project add the following permission (if it's already not there).
```xml

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
```
## Changes in approval call

### Old approval method
```java
SimplUser user = new SimplUser(emailAddress, phoneNumber);
Simpl.getInstance().isUserApproved(user)
                    .addParam("user_location","18.9750,72.8258")
                    .addParam("theatre_location","18.9750,72.8258")
                    .addParam("member_since","(2016-01-08")                                                     
                    .execute(new SimplUserApprovalListener(){
                                /**
                                  * Called when operation is successful
                                  *
                                  * @param status                status of approval : true if user is approved and false if he is not.
                                  * @param showSimplIntroduction Boolean to indicate that User should be shown an introduction
                                  *                              modal related to Simpl
                                  */
                                 void onSuccess(final boolean status, final boolean showSimplIntroduction){
                                 }
                                 /**
                                  * Called when opration is unsuccessful
                                  *
                                  * @param throwable reason of the exception. Use throwable.getMessage() to show user readable error
                                  */
                                 void onError(final Throwable throwable){
                                 }
                             });
```

### New Approval method
```java
SimplUser user = new SimplUser(emailAddress, phoneNumber);
Simpl.getInstance().isUserApproved(user)
                   .addParam("user_location", "18.9750,72.8258")
                   .addParam("order_id", "AB12ORD")
                   .addParam("transaction_amount_in_paise", String.valueOf(transactionAmountInPaise))
                   .addParam("member_since", "2017-01-08")
                   .execute(new SimplUserApprovalListenerV2() {
                                /**
                                * Called when operation is successful
                                *
                                * @param status                status of approval : true if user is approved and false if he is
                                *                              not.
                                * @param buttonText            Text that should appear on Simpl payment option
                                * @param showSimplIntroduction Boolean to indicate that User should be shown an introduction
                                *                              modal related to Simpl
                                */
                                @Override
                                public void onSuccess(boolean status, final String buttonText, boolean showSimplIntroduction) {
                                    // Check the status, If (status is true-> User is approved and show the payment button
                                    // else don't)
                                    // Use "buttonText" to show the same on Payment button
                                }
                                /**
                                * Called when opration is unsuccessful
                                *
                                * @param throwable reason of the exception. Use throwable.getMessage() to show user readable
                                *                  error
                                */
                                @Override
                                public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
            
                                }
                });
```
## Important
Replace callback function ~~SimplUserApprovalListener()~~ with  **SimplUserApprovalListenerV2()**, and override new 
**onSuccess()** method which will have one more argument **String buttonText**

## Changes in Simpl Session
Use ```javaSimpl.getInstance().isSimplApproved()``` to check either user is approved or not in current session.
