# Simpl Android SDK

Simpl's Android SDK makes it easy for you to integrate Simpl Buy into your apps in on the Android platform.

## Adding SDK to your project
### Gradle (Android Studio)
* Add Simpl maven repository to your applications build.gradle.
```groovy
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'http://maven.getsimpl.com'}
    }
```
* Add Simpl as dependency in your project gradle file
```
dependencies {
    compile "com.simpl.android:sdk:1.0.0"
}
```
> __Important__ 

> We are using latest stable Android Build Tool version : 23.0.1, Min SDK Version : 14, Target SDK version 23 and Compile SDK version 23. 

> Check your build.gradle for the project and module to check if you are on the latest versions (> 23.0.1). 

> We are choosing the latest build tool version (23) for Android Marshmallow support. (For release notes : [link]( http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/build-tools.html))

### Maven
Add following dependency and repository to your pom.xml
```xml
<project ...>
<dependecies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.simpl.android</groupId>
        <artifactId>sdk</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>com.simpl</id>
      <url>http://maven.getsimpl.com</url>
    </repository>
 </repositories>
</project>
```

## Update your AndroidManifest.xml
In AndroidManifest.xml of your application project add the following permission (if it's already not there).
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<!-- Required for automatic OTP detection for first time user -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
<application ...>
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.simpl.android.sdk.merchant_id"
        android:value="MERCHANT_ID_FROM_SIMPL_DASHBOARD"/>
</application>
```

## Initialization
```java
/**
 * For initializing Simpl SDK
 *
 * @param applicationContext application context of the current application
 * @param runInSandboxMode boolean flag that indicates if SDK should run in Sandbox mode. If true SDK will run in Sandbox
 * mode else It will run in Production mode
 */
Simpl.init(applicationContext, runInSandboxMode);
```
## Integrating using official Simpl button
### Add following code to your layout file

```xml
<com.simpl.android.sdk.SimplButton
    android:id="@+id/simpl_buy_button"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal"
    android:layout_margin="10dp" />
```
> Add ```android:animateLayoutChanges="true"``` to your parent layout for smooth visibility changes.

### Add following initialization to the corresponding activity
```java
SimplUser user = SimplUser.create(emailAddress, phoneNumber);
SimplTransaction transaction = SimplTransaction.create(user, amountInPaise);
SimplBuyButton button = (SimplBuyButton) findViewById(R.id.simpl_buy_button);
button.setTransaction(transaction);
button.setAuthorizeTransactionListener(new SimplAuthorizeTransactionListener() {
    /**
     * Called when operation is successful
     *
     * @param auth {@link Authorization} module
     */
    void onSuccess(final Authorization auth){
    }
    /**
     * Called when opration is unsuccessful
     *
     * @param throwable reason of the exception. Use throwable.getMessage() to show user readable error
     */
    void onError(final Throwable throwable){
    }
});
```
> __Important__ 
> If user is not approved to use Simpl, SimplBuyButton visibility is set to `GONE`.
> If you want to take control of VISIBILITY then use isUserApproved method explained in the next bit.

### For checking if user is approved
```java
SimplUser user = SimplUser.create(emailAddress, phoneNumber);
Simpl.getInstance().isUserApproved(user, new SimplUserApprovalListener(){
  /**
     * Called when operation is successful
     *
     * @param status status of approval : true if user is approved and false if he is not.
     */
    void onSuccess(final boolean status){
    }
    /**
     * Called when opration is unsuccessful
     *
     * @param throwable reason of the exception. Use throwable.getMessage() to show user readable error
     */
    void onError(final Throwable throwable){
    }
});
```

# FAQs

1) I see an error saying "Couldn't resolve depenedncy "com.simpl.android:data:<version>" on the Android Studio console.

-> It's sometimes because of the redirect failure. Just retry building the app once or twice. If the issue persists contact help@getsimpl.com

2) I see following error in the terminal while building the app using gradle command
   ```console
   Starting a new Gradle Daemon for this build (subsequent builds will be faster).
   Parallel execution with configuration on demand is an incubating feature.
   
   FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
   
   * What went wrong:
   A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
   > Could not download data.aar (com.simpl.android:data:0.0.1)
      > Could not get resource 'http://maven.getsimpl.com/com/simpl/android/data/0.0.1/data-0.0.1.aar'.
         > Could not HEAD 'http://maven.getsimpl.com/com/simpl/android/data/0.0.1/data-0.0.1.aar'. Received status code 502 from server: Bad Gateway
   
   * Try:
   Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
   
   BUILD FAILED
   
   Total time: 2 mins 44.481 secs
  ```

-> This is also the result of redirect failure. Just retry building the app once or twice. If the issue persists contact help@getsimpl.com.
